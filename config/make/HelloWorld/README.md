# makefile

This tutorial assumes that MinGW is correctly installed and its binaries' folder
is added to the `PATH` environment variable.

1. Open a Command Prompt
2. Use Makefile to build the executable main with GCC

```sh
mingw32-make
```

3. Execute the executable file in a Command Prompt or open the file itself

```sh
.\main.exe
```
